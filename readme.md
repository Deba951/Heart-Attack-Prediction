# Heart Disease Prediction

## Introduction

Welcome to the Heart Disease Prediction project repository. This project is aimed at predicting the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health parameters. It involves data analysis, data preprocessing, and the application of machine learning models to make predictions.

## Objective

The main objective of this project is to create a predictive model that can help identify individuals at a higher risk of heart disease. By analyzing a dataset of health parameters, we aim to build accurate models that can assist in early detection and intervention.

## Brief Description about the Project

This project involves the analysis of a dataset containing various health parameters and a binary classification task to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in individuals. The project consists of the following major steps:

1. Importing libraries and dataset.
2. Data understanding and exploration.
3. Data preprocessing and cleaning.
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset.
5. Feature selection and handling multicollinearity.
6. Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
7. Hyperparameter tuning for machine learning models.
8. Model training and evaluation using three different algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

## Importing Libraries and Dataset

This project utilizes several Python libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and visualization. Key libraries include:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Statsmodels

The dataset used in this project is stored in a CSV file named 'heart.csv'.

## Factors or Parameters Considered from the CSV File

The 'heart.csv' dataset contains the following parameters that are considered for heart disease prediction:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest pain type
- Resting blood pressure
- Cholesterol
- Exercise-induced angina
- Fasting blood sugar
- Resting electrocardiographic results
- Maximum heart rate achieved
- Slope of ST segment
- Number of major vessels
- Thallium stress test result

## Steps Included in this Project

The project encompasses the following key steps:
1. Data loading and library import.
2. Data exploration to understand the dataset's structure and features.
3. Data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values, outliers, and duplicates.
4. In-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize and understand the data.
5. Feature selection and evaluation of multicollinearity.
6. Data splitting into training and testing sets.
7. Hyperparameter tuning for three machine learning models.
8. Model training, evaluation, and performance comparison.

## Description and Insight

This project aims to identify early indicators of heart disease by analyzing various health parameters. It involves data preprocessing to clean and prepare the data for analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) provides valuable insights into the dataset, enabling us to make informed decisions regarding feature selection and model training.

The feature selection process involves considering parameters with significant influence on heart disease prediction and handling multicollinearity to ensure model accuracy. Hyperparameter tuning is performed to optimize the machine learning models' performance.

Three modeling procedures are employed in this project:
1. **Logistic Regression**: A widely used classification algorithm that estimates the probability of a binary outcome.
2. **Decision Tree**: A tree-structured model that makes decisions based on the input features.
3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful algorithm for classification and regression tasks.

The models are evaluated using confusion matrices and classification reports, providing insights into their performance in predicting heart disease.

## Conclusion

This project combines data analysis and machine learning to address the critical issue of heart disease prediction. By following the steps outlined in this repository, you can gain insights into the dataset, select the most relevant features, and create predictive models that aid in early detection and intervention for heart disease.
